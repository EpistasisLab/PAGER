Command to create GRM

# Gemma was run using singularity

# Before creating a GRM, create a allExcept.chr1.bimbam file. Use the script "convert_csv_to_bimbam_file.py" to create bimbam files per chromosome. Then use cat to create a allExcept file for a particular chromosome by concatenating the bimbam file of all chromosomes except the one you are excluding. For example, if you are are creating a allExcept.chr1.bimbam file, concatenate the bimbam files of all chromosomes except the bimbam file of chromosome 1.

singularity exec -B /path/:/path/ docker://pgcbioinfo/gemma gemma -g allExcept.chrX.bimbam -p phenotype_file -gk 1 -o allExcept.chrX.GRM

where 
-g is the allExcept file for the chromosome X that you are interested in,
-p is the phenotype file
-gk 1 calculated the centered relatedness matrix
-o is the GRM generated by excluding the chromosome X. Once this command is run, you would obtain the GRM in a file with the prefix provided and ending in cXX.txt
