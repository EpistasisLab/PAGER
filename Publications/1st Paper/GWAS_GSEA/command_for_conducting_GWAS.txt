Command to conduct GWAS

# Gemma was run using singularity

# Before running GWAS, create a SNP annotation file for each chromosome using the script "get_snpinfo_file.py". The SNP annotation file will contain the SNPs for that chromosome, the base pair position and the chromosome it is present on

singularity exec -B /path/:/path/ docker://pgcbioinfo/gemma gemma -g chrX.bimbam -p phenotype_file -n 1 -k allExcept.chrX.GRM.cXX.txt -a chrX_snp_annotation_file -lmm 4 -o chrX.gwas.out 

where 
-g is the bimbam file for that chromosome
-p is the phenotype file
-n is to specify the phenotype column (Here, the phenotype column is in the first column)
-k is the GRM file for that chromosome
-a is the SNP annotation file
-lmm is the linear mixed model options (4 is to specify all statistical tests)
-o is the prefix for the gwas output
